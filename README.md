## 💡 What We Did

Our approach in the **IMC Prosperity 3** competition was centered around a blend of algorithmic trading strategies and advanced quantitative models to navigate the market’s ups and downs.

### 🔍 Key Strategies:
- **Arbitrage Trading:** Identifying price discrepancies between related assets for risk-free profit opportunities.  
- **Volatility Arbitrage:** Taking advantage of market inefficiencies in volatility predictions, paired with options pricing.  
- **Mean Reversion Algorithms:** Predicting market returns by identifying assets that have deviated from their historical mean, betting on a reversion.  
- **Options Trading & Delta Hedging:** Using the Black-Scholes model to price options, and implementing delta hedging strategies to mitigate risk and lock in profits.
<br/>

### ⚙️ Advanced Techniques:
- **Traffic & Storage Cost Analysis:** We explored the impact of transaction costs, latency, and data storage, optimising strategies for low-latency execution and minimising operational expenses.  
- **Risk Management:** Implementing real-time adjustments to manage exposure, using techniques such as stop-loss orders and portfolio diversification.

We applied a range of **machine learning techniques** to optimise decision-making and improve the robustness of our trading models in different market conditions.
