## ⚙️ **Algorithmic Challenge**

The islanders love their picnics — and now, **Picnic Baskets** are part of the trade!

### 🧺 New Products:

#### `PICNIC_BASKET1` includes:
- 6 × `CROISSANTS`  
- 3 × `JAMS`  
- 1 × `DJEMBE`

#### `PICNIC_BASKET2` includes:
- 4 × `CROISSANTS`  
- 2 × `JAMS`

Each individual product (`CROISSANTS`, `JAMS`, `DJEMBES`) is also **tradable on its own**, introducing new arbitrage, decomposition, and bundling opportunities.

### 📈 Position Limits:
- `CROISSANTS`: 250  
- `JAMS`: 350  
- `DJEMBES`: 60  
- `PICNIC_BASKET1`: 60  
- `PICNIC_BASKET2`: 100

Our goal? Identify mispricings between basket components and individual instruments, exploit inefficiencies, and manage inventory risk across multiple correlated assets.

## 💸 **Manual Challenge**

Washed ashore: **mystery containers filled with treasure.** But there's a twist — **others are looting them too.**

### How It Works:
- Pick **up to 2 containers**.
  - First pick = free 💰  
  - Second pick = costs SeaShells 💸
- Rewards are based on:
  - **Treasure Multiplier** (up to 90)  
  - **Number of claimants**  
  - **Global popularity of the container**

> 🧮 **Reward = (10,000 × multiplier) / (inhabitants + global popularity factor)**

Choose wisely. A treasure split too many ways might leave you with crumbs.
